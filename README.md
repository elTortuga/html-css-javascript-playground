# Playground for HTML CSS and JavaScript
>Just an area for what begins as playing around or practice that eventually leads to something new.

## Structure
For now all files are located in the root directory but once the size reaches a certain threshhold files will be divided into folders such as beginner, intermediate and advanced... or instead of a structure based on complexity or skill level maybe a structure based on folders containing small singular examples vs folders containing refined examples with a collection of portfolios.  Maybe the structure will have some combinations of the two styles.
