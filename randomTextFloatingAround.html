    // Example of text moving randomly around the screen.  Possible use for a minor effect for a blog or text heavy page on a site.
    // Technologies used: css - transition, translate, opacity; html -  dom manipulation; javascript - file access, object creation, random, math
    //
    /* Randomly chosen text will move across the screen with a low opacity level.  
    Starting positions will be off screen at any of the sides and move towards 
    the opposite side (right to left, above to belog...) until the text is 
    complete off screen.  Once text is no longer visible on the screen it will 
    be removed. Text will never be upside down but it's angle will match the 
    angle of the direction it is moving in. The text will be made from a 
    collecition of quotes from a local file.*/
